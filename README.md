# Color-Models

I explored the graphics capabilities of Python and worked on GUI applications and discovered the many different ways to represent color, and the choice of color model often depends on the application. For example, RGB is used when the colors need to be displayed on a computer monitor (such as a web site), while CMYK is often used for printing out colors on paper.

I was introduced to three color models that are used in computing and graphics, giving me practice with writing complex functions with conditionals as well as experience using traces to test and debug a program. Furthermore, I experienced using asserts to bolseer preconditions and with Python application that spans multiple modules. Lastly, I recognized that notion of attribute invariants.

Important: Python has a built-in color conversion module called colorsys.
